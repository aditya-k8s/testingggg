                Case studies are a valuable research method for gaining a deep
                understanding of complex phenomena and generating insights that
                can inform theory, practice, and policy. Our case study approach
                involves collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources
                such as interviews, observations, and documents.

                        Automobile industry is a fast-paced industry that knows
                        the importance of innovation and has embraced every new
                        kind of technology that has been part of its development
                        until now. Information Technology has been the enabler
                        of the automotive industry for the better part of two
                        decades now and it has helped develop crucial areas from
                        inbuilt navigation, self-parking and self-driving car
                        heads up display, etc. IT also enables smoother
                        communication and better integration of the supply chain
                        between dealers, manufacturers, and customers.

                        With millennials and gen z entering the market to buy
                        their first vehicle; dealerships and manufacturers have
                        come to understand that these buyers generally prefer to
                        research online before making a buying decision, and
                        hence these stakeholders are using this as an
                        opportunity to revamp their websites as per the needs of
                        these prospective customers. Websites act as a
                        facilitator for these millennials and gen z customers as
                        they can know every basic detail about vehicle right
                        away from the website; they can check all the latest
                        offers available to them. As for dealers, the website
                        acts as a qualified lead generator and people you can
                        target further.

                      <p>
                        The website’s discoverability depends a lot upon the
                        ranking of the website across the search engine results
                        page. Something which has become exceptionally difficult
                        for the past two decades. This is where search engine
                        optimization (SEO) helps. SEO helps websites improve
                        their rankings, which increases discoverability, thus
                        also helping those websites. This is particularly true
                        for websites that offer reviews on different types of
                        vehicles. These websites rely heavily on their
                        discoverability and hence for them having the right SEO
                        strategy is imperative. This is where an SEO service
                        provider is beneficial as they improve the website’s
                        crawlability by helping improve UI and UX, content of
                        the website, remove dead pages, improve and create meta
                        descriptions, etc., and that improves the website’s
                        ranking.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A website stored on a physical server is at a far higher
                        risk of crashing than its cloud counterparts. As
                        cloud-based websites aren’t dependent upon physical
                        servers to be kept running by the dealer or
                        manufacturer. These servers also take a backup of all
                        website data and hence can restore data to the last
                        point of fault. All this leads to increased mental
                        security for the dealer, company, or manufacturer as an
                        assurance of services is there even as something broke
                        down. A cloud infrastructure provider assists in
                        achieving this.

                        A significant part of marketing nowadays happens across
                        social media cause that is where people are most active
                        during the day. Using social media cars, bikes,
                        scooters, etc. features are showcased. Some brands are
                        really taking their social media game very seriously
                        with brands sometimes going live across social media
                        platforms for new launches. On the other hand,
                        dealerships are leveraging the power of social media
                        even more effectively, they also showcase the products
                        they have available, allowing prospective customers to
                        directly message them about their queries. Some
                        dealerships also offer special kinds of offers and
                        discounts to their social media leads.

                        Manufacturers are exploring other areas where they can
                        interact with their customers directly and not be
                        dependent upon dealers. So, to avoid dealers and provide
                        better control over their products and services
                        manufacturers are getting mobile apps developed. These
                        apps provide services like turn-by-turn navigation
                        built-in, location tracking of vehicles, and service
                        reminder among other things. By having these apps
                        directly on their consumer’s phones, manufacturers know
                        what kind of features their customers expect of them.
                        Also, these apps aid in increasing the revenue of
                        manufacturers while also helping consumers thus proving
                        to be a win-win situation for everyone.

                      <p>
                        For dealerships and manufacturers, it is imperative that
                        they must know exactly the amount of inventory they have
                        as having too much or too little can be detrimental to
                        the business. They have understood this lesson and
                        already investing in a good CRM, inventory management
                        system which can integrate with their supply chain. This
                        software exists as desktop-based applications or
                        web-based applications with each providing its own set
                        of benefits and drawbacks one over the other; however,
                        it is much better than trying to maintain inventory
                        manually. They also provide the ability to automate
                        things, thus providing staff members with time to
                        innovate and look for other avenues of growth.

                        banks, hedge funds, stock market brokers, etc. everyone
                        understands the importance of having a website as most
                        of the transactions happen digitally. For every query
                        that people have, they resort to online search as the
                        resolution over there is much simpler and requires time
                        which is insignificant if they were to contact their
                        bank, hedge fund manager, or stock market broker. Banks
                        are also deploying chatbots on their websites which can
                        resolve all the basic queries of their customers.
                        Websites with an extra set of security built in also
                        allow internet banking, electronic fund transfer,
                        placing orders for stocks, etc. all this is leading to
                        more convenience to customers.{" "}

                        As more people are starting to invest across the globe,
                        financial education is also on the rise. More websites
                        are being set up that offer the basics of investing, how
                        to select the right stock to invest in, and how to read
                        a balance sheet, among other things.{" "}

                      <p>
                        While setting up your website is the first step towards
                        the digitization of financial services, it is just half
                        of the job done. Websites need to be well-polished with
                        great UI and UX, and content should be easier to
                        understand. Websites having great SEO rank higher and
                        hence can attract most of the audience traffic. Higher
                        traffic also leads to increase leads and more customers;
                        thus SEO helps increase the customer base. This is true
                        in every sense for websites that offer courses related
                        to financial education as they get the best out of
                        traffic that lands on their websites. By using a website
                        for selling courses, they can monitor every step of the
                        client journey, and hence can optimize every step to
                        increase sales even more.

                        With the increased penetration of social media apps and
                        websites, social media influencer culture has increased
                        manifold in almost every discipline. A countless number
                        of social media influencers in finance or
                        financeprenuers are on the rise. They impart financial
                        education, content that helps people save money, teach
                        people about different kinds of financial instruments,
                        and everything in between. However, they may not know
                        how to use analytics of social media to gain even more
                        followers which further translates to more sales. This
                        is where a digital marketing agency helps as they
                        analyze analytics, create content calendars, help set up
                        webinars, etc., all these further increase audience
                        engagement.

                        New-age financial investment instruments like
                        Cryptocurrency have blockchain as its underlying
                        technology is blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed
                        database where data is stored across a network of
                        computers. In the case of a decentralized blockchain,
                        the data once entered is irreversible. This makes every
                        transaction highly secure. So many new Cryptocurrencies
                        are being set up which are leveraging this technology
                        with the hope that as Cryptocurrency becomes more
                        accessible, it shall become the currency of the future.
                        To develop the tokens which are used often requires a
                        lot of expertise something which may not be available,
                        and entrepreneurs often hire developers who have
                        experience in developing it.

                        For higher penetration of financial services in people’s
                        hands, it is a must that people can do financial
                        transactions from Smartphones. Hence, financial
                        institutions have been rolling out mobile apps which
                        help do every transaction from their Smartphone
                        directly. From money transfers, to placing orders online
                        all those transactions can be done through mobile apps
                        and the infrastructure built around them. With more
                        people doing transactions on their phones, fewer people
                        are likely to visit banks for their day-to-day money
                        transfer and shopping needs.{" "}

                      <p>
                        The hospitality industry has been the backbone of any
                        tourism-dominated country, and it has been one of those
                        industries that have been labor-intensive. However, the
                        COVID-19 pandemic changed the hospitality industry
                        completely. Many hotels had to let go of their staff or
                        severely cut the salaries of their employees to keep the
                        business running. As a result of this, even smaller
                        establishments are embracing technology to better tap
                        prospective customers and generate higher revenue and
                        margins from those customers while also maintaining
                        excellent relationships with existing and returning
                        customers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For hotels, having a website acts as a value-adding and
                        the first point of digital contact with prospective
                        clients. They can check out amenities, room layout,
                        reviews, and tariffs and book rooms directly through the
                        website. This allows hotels to increase transparency in
                        their tariffs and have better control over the client
                        experience. Also, for any hotel, it is important that
                        they are able to integrate their CRM with their website,
                        as that gives them an exact idea about the availability
                        of a particular room at the time of booking. Similarly,
                        some fancy restaurants only allow for a sure occupancy
                        and are known to be booked throughout the year. They
                        often take appointments exclusively through websites
                        nowadays, as this allows restaurants to be better
                        equipped for the number of guests they are expecting on
                        a particular day. Also, it also allows everyone a fair
                        chance of getting a booking at their dream restaurant.

                        As Walt Disney wisely said, "People spend money when and
                        where they feel good." The whole hospitality industry
                        works on the premise that they are here to make the
                        customer feel good. This starts with the customer's
                        journey when they start searching for a hotel to stay in
                        or a restaurant to eat in. Websites are optimized to
                        rank higher in search engines, and some are even
                        resorting to cross-search engine advertising because
                        search engines are the first place people look for
                        hotels, restaurants, cafes, and so on. As Smartphone
                        penetration has increased in the market, so has social
                        media usage. Restaurants, hotels, cafes, and bakeries
                        have recognized this and are making extensive use of
                        social media. Beautiful images of dishes, cakes,
                        ambiance, facilities, and any other fun videos that
                        encourage engagement are shared. All this encourages
                        people to follow the business, and people remember the
                        establishment when visiting there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So a little investment in social media leads to
                        astronomical results for the establishment. These
                        establishments are also leveraging the power of social
                        media to answer questions from people; thus making sure
                        that people feel that they are being heard - which in
                        turn further boosts the reputation of the establishment
                        in people’s eyes.

                        New-age consumers are the ones who generally check
                        everything online through their handheld devices. Having
                        a mobile app thus gives a competitive advantage over
                        everyone who is not investing in it. Generally, all
                        hotels are registered with one hotel aggregator or
                        another. That means they end up paying commission to
                        them, which could be avoided or completely done away
                        with in the long run if your hotel has its own mobile
                        app. Customers can book rooms, check tariffs, and get
                        discounts and other offers directly from the app.
                        Another use case is online ordering. Ordering food from
                        a Smartphone has become significantly easier. This has
                        led to an increase in cloud kitchens. These cloud
                        kitchens employ a lot of people throughout the value
                        chain and contribute to the economy. None of this would
                        have been possible without mobile apps.

                      <p>
                        Hotels, restaurants, cafes, etc. have realized the
                        importance of having a desktop solution that helps keep
                        track of rooms’ availability, monitor inventory, monitor
                        budget, check client history and even payroll
                        management. They are resorting to getting custom
                        solutions built for them, which they can scale in the
                        future and have various privacy safeguards that a white
                        box solution could never match. This software is further
                        integrated into their website or mobile app, which
                        allows them to automate the process of booking rooms as
                        per availability.

                        Fancy hotels across the globe have already implemented
                        smart keys for doors. With some going even further and
                        using Smartphone-activated doors (initially, it was
                        developed as a response to the pandemic), and the
                        general customer reaction to this change was generally
                        positive; hence it stayed. This avoids the issue of
                        hotel keys being lost in addition to providing a high
                        level of security for the room occupant. Smart devices
                        which leverage the power of WiFi are also being
                        integrated into hotel rooms as a single app can be used
                        to control all these appliances;, thus adding further
                        convenience to guests of the hotel.

                        The hospitality industry has embraced technology to

                        stakeholders. As technology continues to evolve, so

                        According to the Cambridge Dictionary definition, sport
                        is defined as a game, competition, or activity needing
                        physical effort and skill that is played or done
                        according to rules, for enjoyment and/or as a job.
                        Sports have been an integral part of human society and
                        they have helped humans to develop social skills such as
                        being happy while being competitive, how to control and
                        manage your anger, how to cooperate with others, etc.

                      <p>
                        This has meant that the sports industry would be an
                        imperative part of human civilization. With such
                        enthusiasm has the sports industry grown that it is now
                        a $501.43 Billion industry, as per research and markets
                        report. The sports industry was among the pioneers to
                        take advantage of technology when it began radio
                        announced and then live telecasted on television. So, it
                        was only logical that the sports industry would embrace
                        even more technology and would get ahead of other
                        industries in entertaining the masses while also using
                        technology to improve athletes’ performance.

                        Brick-and-mortar shops, especially those associated with
                        adventure sports such as snowboarding, surfing, mountain
                        biking, etc. are among the principal beneficiaries of
                        using technology to increase awareness and attract
                        customers which in turn leads to sales. Since the
                        average amount of investment in these sports is higher
                        so customers generally require more persuasion. These
                        shops generally invest in websites and social media
                        extensively. They use social media to showcase beautiful
                        images of their offerings, and special offers that are
                        ongoing and using the power of tracking offered by
                        social media to deliver specially targeted ads for their
                        products once the customer is on the journey to purchase
                        the product, they gently nudge the customer to their
                        aesthetically laid out yet simple website where products
                        can be purchased without any hassle.

                        sports clubs with a huge fan following are leveraging
                        the power of social media to stay connected with their
                        fans. They often work with digital marketing agencies
                        that help them devise the message they want to deliver
                        online and help clubs increase their following as well.
                        As these followers or fans act as a social currency for
                        these brands. They get to know about every announcement
                        of their clubs on the club’s social media page this also
                        acts as a place to unveil new kits and merchandise,
                        which further connects to websites or mobile apps. These
                        websites or mobile apps are proving to be the one-stop
                        shop to buy match tickets, merchandise, and a lot more,
                        directly from the clubs thus providing them with other
                        sources of revenue.

                        Sports stadiums are known to host great matches from
                        memorable football matches between countries to clubs,
                        cricket matches, and track and field events. However,
                        stadium owners are now leveraging the huge amount of
                        space that they have for other purposes as well.
                        Recently some stadiums are allowing wedding parties to
                        be held at their stadium. Some stadiums are already
                        known to host more than one football club all this
                        illustrates that stadiums are multipurpose places and
                        hence it is imperative that there exists a website which
                        allows people to see the stadium in its full glory. This
                        website can function as a one-stop place where people
                        can book it for different activities.{" "}

                        Online gaming is gaining a lot of traction over the last
                        five years. The pandemic only increased it further. Many
                        online gaming studios are developing their own
                        technology stack on their websites for people to enjoy
                        games. Many game streaming platforms are also
                        mushrooming; these platforms require extremely fast and
                        responsive websites along with big data servers to be
                        able to host the amount of data that is sent through
                        these games. Some platforms are also issuing
                        non-fungible tokens to players online for various game
                        tournaments that happen on these platforms.

                        At the university and school levels, they provide
                        opportunities for budding athletes to develop and turn
                        into professionals with the right guidance and training
                        regime that is offered. However, maintaining football
                        fields or basketball courts, or stadiums for track and
                        field events is not an easy expense. To circumvent this,
                        some universities and schools have started broadcasting
                        their sports events live. Using the latest cameras and
                        technology equipment has become possible. Also, they are
                        incorporating video recording software which can record
                        the matches, which can later be uploaded across social
                        media platforms or on YouTube, Daily motion, etc. All
                        this allows maintaining these expensive stadiums easy on
                        the universities and schools.

                        Sports have been an important part of human civilization
                        from time immemorial. They have helped the human race
                        develop various social skills and the sports industry
                        itself has employed countless people directly or
                        indirectly. IT is just helping them attract other
                        avenues of growth so that they can all stay afloat, and

                        Fashion is an industry that has relied on the creativity
                        and artistic expression of designers worldwide to
                        produce clothing lines that enter the mass-market once
                        they have been worn by models at various fashion weeks
                        across the globe.

                      <p>
                        However, fashion for mass-market consumers has been more
                        about affordability and the ability for them to look
                        chic and trendy without exorbitant spending. In this
                        area, recently, the fashion industry has started to rely
                        on technology to deliver people what they desire while
                        also keeping a check on their inventory and pushing
                        innovation to cater to their consumers even better.

                      <p>
                        Here, we’ll explain where IT is being used across the
                        fashion industry:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Fashion brands across the globe were challenged by the
                        COVID-19 pandemic. They were forced to innovate in more
                        ways than one. As the pandemic was ravaging the planet,
                        a lot of brands also saw this as an opportunity to sell
                        custom masks online. A new category of clothing
                        accessories was created all of a sudden, and brands were
                        able to capitalize upon this just because they had data
                        regarding what people were buying online.
                        Brick-and-mortar fashion store brands realized the
                        importance of having an on line presence, something that
                        they weren’t doing before the pandemic. Bigger brands,
                        which were independent or part of a large umbrella group
                        company, resorted to direct-to-customer (D2C) selling
                        through e-commerce websites. By doing so, they were able
                        to tap into new customers, which in turn led to the
                        efficient use of inventory and healthier margins for
                        brands. Everyone, whether they own a nail art store,
                        someone who offers a one-stop solution for men’s or
                        women’s clothing, or a big brand offering all kinds of

                        new customer acquisition as well as retention of old
                        customers.

                        Brands rely heavily on market trends and the
                        word-of-mouth that surrounds them. This is especially
                        true for fashion brands. Thus, brands often have an
                        in-house marketing team who observes their brand's
                        perception online, helping avoid situations of bad PR
                        for the brand. However, it is much more difficult for a
                        new brand to hire someone solely for this purpose, so
                        they frequently hire a digital marketing agency to do it
                        for them. They help maintain a positive perception of
                        the brand. They also create engaging posts for their
                        followers as well as help create social media campaigns
                        that lead to better lead generation and conversion. A
                        digital marketing agency also helps brands craft and
                        coordinate messages they want social media influencers
                        to deliver to the brand’s audience, thus leading to even
                        better social value for the brand.

                        E-commerce websites are just one of the ways by which
                        brands are targeting sales; the other being mobile apps.
                        According to the Statista study, nearly half (49.2
                        percent) of e-commerce sales will be made via mobile
                        devices in 2020. This clearly shows the power of
                        handheld devices, and hence, more and more brands are
                        embracing the idea of having a mobile application for
                        their brand. Mobile apps provide a convenient way for
                        people to buy online from the palm of their hand. They
                        provide a sense of ease which even logging on to the
                        website doesn’t. As a plus point, it is much easier to
                        leverage technologies like AR and VR to overhaul the
                        consumer experience.

                      <p>
                        To increase sales and better customer engagement, brands
                        are embracing technologies like augmented reality and
                        virtual reality. AR (Augmented Reality) integrates
                        digital information with a user’s environment in
                        real-time; whereas VR (Virtual Reality) is a simulation
                        in which a person can interact with a 3-d visual or
                        sensory environment. Recently, some brands have begun to
                        roll out filters across social media platforms on their
                        ads, allowing a person to see in AR how that dress would
                        feel on them after clicking the ad, and some eyewear
                        brands use AR to allow you to see how certain eyeglasses
                        will feel on your face. All this leads to a better
                        customer experience and also leads to better social
                        advocacy by people who find this feature worthwhile.

                        With the rise of modern fashion brands, the use of AI in
                        the fashion industry has increased a lot. AI has been
                        helping brands by churning out new designs in no time;
                        personalized shoes, dresses, and accessories; detecting
                        fake merchandise which circulates in the market; and
                        lastly, one of the most important uses of AI has been in
                        forecasting designs, trends, and color patterns which
                        are expected to be in fashion for the season; thus
                        allowing brands to invest in them primarily.

                      <p>
                        As brands streamline their processes to increase
                        efficiency and productivity, something that can’t be
                        overlooked is how they manage their inventory. These
                        brands rely on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
                        smart stickers or tags, which are used in digital
                        cataloging. Furthermore, these tags are used for highly
                        targeted sales, stocking, and availability. Some brands
                        are even using RFID tags to suggest what other garments
                        can go with them, thus providing you with a complete
                        look. To counter their supply chain woes, brands are
                        also using web apps that are integrated with their
                        inventory and their factories, which allow for better
                        tracking at each step of the way.

                        Fashion brands had realized before the pandemic that
                        they needed to overhaul their processes and embrace
                        technology if they wanted to stay relevant and fresh in
                        the eyes of their consumers. The pandemic just brought
                        the required change a lot faster than they expected, and
                        as brands move to embrace technology as a part of their
                        culture, and we are helping them realize their
                        potential.

                        Information technology has touched almost every industry
                        to the point where it is now synonymous with every
                        industry. Insurance is no different; with the large
                        amount of data that insurance companies have, it is
                        important that they are able to utilize this data to get
                        even better results in providing insurance coverage
                        while being able to calculate risk in a manner that
                        isn’t detrimental to their own interests.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Right off the bat, insurance companies are providing
                        various kinds of services like change of nominee, change
                        of address, payment mode change, raising a claim
                        request, etc. right from their websites, as they
                        understand that people may not have time to visit the
                        insurance provider in a lot of situations and would
                        benefit from these services being available on the
                        website. By providing these facilities on the website,
                        it is guaranteed that these changes will take place in
                        their own database as well. Through websites, people can
                        also know their premium renewal date, pay premium
                        online, and generate their payment slip, etc., thereby,
                        adding more convenience to users as well as insurance
                        companies as they do not have to maintain this data
                        manually.

                      <p>
                        Like mobile banking, mobile apps are also being
                        developed by various insurance providers which allow for
                        easier premium payment, insurance policy renewal date,
                        downloading policy details, and direct onboarding for a
                        certain kind of insurance policy. This adds another
                        touch point for users to avail the facility, and mobile
                        app users are much more likely to pay insurance premiums
                        on time, hence being beneficial to users as well as
                        insurance providers.

                        Using technology to help underwrite policies and
                        Artificial Intelligence, many new startups in the
                        insurance sector have been set up that use technology in
                        every step of the way to interact with consumers. By
                        keeping human interaction to a minimum, these startups
                        are saving money, which is transferred to clients, and
                        hence policies are sold at highly competitive rates.

                      <p>
                        To analyze the huge amounts of data insurance companies
                        have at their hands, different kinds of proprietary
                        software are used, which considers all the data that
                        they have. This software helps understand patterns
                        across different regions; and hence, insurance companies
                        can tailor their offerings accordingly. This software
                        also helps calculate the reinsurance amount that should
                        be charged; as insurance companies frequently offer a
                        discount for renewing policies with them. Similar kinds
                        of software are also developed that help expedite the
                        process of claim processing.

                        To leverage the power of social media and to provide
                        convenience to policyholders, insurance companies are
                        also using different social media channels to get their
                        message to the right audience. As social media provides
                        highly targeted delivery of content to your audience,
                        various kinds of targeted ads can be shown to people
                        searching for insurance policies across social media
                        apps, which can lead to inexpensive lead generation
                        compared to other media platforms. Insurance is a
                        heavily regulated sector, so newer innovations are hard
                        to come by.

                      <p>
                        Despite this, the insurance sector has embraced IT to
                        provide more convenience to customers, analyze data to
                        produce better products and offerings, provide policies
                        at competitive rates, etc. We would love to help you get
                        better at your insurance offerings by providing you with
                        a digital approach across various verticals.

                        With the turn of the century, global tourism has
                        increased a lot. People often travel within the country
                        and sometimes to other countries. This educates them
                        about the difference in culture in other countries and
                        sometimes within the country as well. In the last
                        decade; however, the general age of travelers has
                        decreased, and they generally fall in the category of
                        millennials and gen z. This has prompted travel
                        agencies, destination outlets, agents, etc. find the way
                        how they interact with this new audience.

                        The bare minimum search for any destination starts on
                        the internet these days. People type their queries on
                        search engines and are delivered results. They are
                        treated with various websites, some informative, some
                        travel agencies, and some travel agents that help people
                        plan their vacations. In the case of informative
                        websites, they provide ideas about the places you could
                        visit, main attractions in the area, how to reach and
                        sometimes have partnered with hotels in the area to
                        provide discounts. On the contrary, in the case of
                        travel agencies, they provide a one-stop solution for
                        the entire trip with strategic partnerships with hotels,
                        restaurants, destination outlets, entertainment centers,
                        etc.

                        No matter how good the website is if it isn’t getting
                        organic traffic, it would become difficult for it to
                        sustain. Hence, travel agencies, agents, and even
                        informative websites often take the services of digital
                        marketing agencies. These agencies help identify
                        opportunities to tap into organic traffic by revamping
                        the content of the website, having better blog posts,
                        and improving the UI and UX of the website. Not only
                        this they help plan social media strategy right from
                        content to when certain content shall be uploaded to
                        what kind of audience they want to target. These
                        agencies also help travel agencies partner with travel
                        bloggers or vloggers who visit these places and in
                        return feature them in the blogs or vlogs or social
                        media pages. This in turn leads to higher organic reach
                        for these travel agencies and better client retention as
                        well as easier new client acquisition.{" "}

                        To further tap into different customer segments, travel
                        agencies are also getting mobile apps developed. Current
                        search trends also seem to indicate arguments in favor
                        of it as more people search for things on mobile devices
                        hence it is imperative that their first contact with any
                        travel agency is good. By having a dedicated mobile app,
                        people can book itineraries right from it, check the
                        flight schedule, hotel confirmation, etc. right from the
                        app. The mobile app is also paving way for innovations
                        such as AR and VR to be integrated into them. These
                        technologies further enhance user experience thus
                        fueling buying decisions.

                        With the vast amount of data travel agencies handle and
                        have of their clients it is paramount that they invest
                        in a desktop or web app solution that assists them in
                        getting insights into customer spending, which
                        destinations are preferred at a particular time of the
                        year, which are the preferred destinations, automation
                        of tasks like taking client data from a website to be
                        stored on their servers etc. all these valuable insights
                        can help in tailoring offers to clients. This software
                        also keeps client history and thus helps offer certain
                        discounts to loyal customers something which wouldn’t
                        have been possible earlier.

                        A chain is as strong as its weakest link; this cannot be
                        truer for a website. As for the website, the amount of
                        uptime it has reflects the amount of money it can for
                        the travel agency. Travel agencies have already moved or
                        are moving from physical servers to cloud-based servers
                        to drive their business because it is much easier and
                        more affordable to maintain than their physical
                        counterparts. They also provide backup support which is
                        essential for any business.

                        Web browsers are starting to get tougher on third-party
                        cookies this is in line with the general perception that
                        it causes too much amount of data collection by websites
                        and various laws are being passed in different countries
                        that are making privacy enforcement necessary. Websites
                        are getting prepared for a world without third-party
                        cookies, but this also means that they invest in good
                        CRM (customer relationship manager) software that helps
                        make informed decisions on first-party cookies data. A
                        good CRM software uses all this first-party data to
                        prepare a general idea of a client whose websites, in
                        turn, create an offer, especially for that client which
                        is delivered generally through emails as email still has
                        the highest ROI which is achieved via email automation
                        software.

                        interaction shall be through digital means. If you are

                        Information technology has helped every sector innovate
                        and become more productive. It has become a backbone of
                        a lot of sectors and has helped them tide over the
                        pandemic. It is no wonder that IT was the most
                        profitable sector during the pandemic and was able to
                        keep the best talent employed. Under IT, various models
                        work; such as application outsourcing, business process
                        outsourcing, and infrastructure outsourcing.

                        With the rise of the Software as a Service (SAAS) model,
                        a lot of companies are working on creating software that
                        helps other businesses automate processes, handle lead
                        generation, integrate one application with another,
                        etc.; since all their resources are tied up in
                        developing the software, providing support, and
                        maintenance. They are short-staffed, when it comes to
                        developing a website; so they frequently hire developers
                        to assist them in developing websites that are fast,
                        fluid, responsive, SEO-friendly and tailored to the
                        needs of the company. These developers create bespoke
                        websites which appeal to the company’s target audience
                        and help showcase the software in action through videos,
                        blogs, etc., while also acting as lead generators for
                        the companies.

                        The development in technology has pushed the boundaries
                        of the kinds of devices that have become available on
                        the market; from smart bulbs, fans, ACs, to TVs, and
                        refrigerators. All of this has meant that providing
                        security across this myriad of devices has become a
                        problem. Many cyber security startups are working on
                        setting up firewalls that even prevent these devices
                        from getting attacked by cybercriminals. Similar to SAAS
                        partners, they also require websites to showcase their
                        portfolio, provide support, generate leads, etc. Their
                        inexperience in handling social media also means that
                        they work with digital marketing agencies who help them
                        chart out social media strategy, where and when to
                        target ads, how to leverage social media data to better
                        tailor offers, etc.

                        IT outsourcing firms often have too many hats to wear.
                        They go from preparing social media strategies for their
                        clients, writing great copy for clients, creating
                        software solutions, creating APIs, etc., to a point
                        where their own website content suffers sometimes. They
                        require educational and engaging content with which they
                        can showcase their current as well as prospective
                        clients. Hence, they often hire copywriters who help
                        keep the firm’s website content updated with the latest
                        offerings, case studies, blogs, etc.

                        As remote working became the norm because of the
                        pandemic, firms were forced to invest in solutions that
                        made remote working easier. Some decided to use already
                        available solutions on the market from various players.
                        However, some companies saw this as an opportunity to
                        get their own solution, which assisted them with the
                        hope that they could market it in the future. Though
                        developing a desktop or mobile app is easier said than
                        done, most decide to hire desktop or mobile app
                        developers who make those apps for them. By having a
                        custom solution, they are assured of the data security
                        that firms highly value. Also, this one-time cost would
                        be more beneficial to them than paying for a yearly
                        model.

                        For any firm working in IT, whether it is in cyber
                        security, CRM, social media scheduling, analytics, etc.,
                        having no downtime for their website is a must if they
                        want to succeed in the highly competitive tech space. To
                        achieve that, websites are moved from physical server
                        models to cloud-based solutions as they provide no
                        downtime, frequent backups, restoring to the last
                        version, etc. among the few features offered. Although
                        not everyone has expertise in it, they often hire cloud-
                        server developers who assist in the transition of the
                        website; so that the firm's core business doesn’t get
                        hampered.

                        Information technology as a service (ITaaS) has
                        completely revolutionized the way IT is being
                        approached. Rather than considering IT only for solving
                        issues with other sectors, it is also helping firms
                        already working in the IT industry to leverage the power
                        of developers, marketers, copywriters, etc. to improve
                        their own businesses; which in turn helps them serve
                        other businesses better. If your IT firm is in need of
                        resources to improve workflow, we would be happy to

                        ERP or Enterprise Resource Planning is a type of
                        software used by companies to manage their day-to-day
                        business which includes accounting, compliance, human
                        resources, salary allocation, lead generation, lead
                        monitoring, etc. All these features in built-in ERP help
                        companies stay ahead of these issues; thereby the
                        company can focus on their core business more easily and
                        efficiently.

                      <p>
                        ERP software enables faster intra and inter-departmental
                        communication as the data available to across
                        departments and within the department is encapsulated
                        and is only available as per roles decided thus
                        providing complete privacy of data.

                      <p>
                        For any organization having a website is a must however
                        linking their ERP software with the website is easier
                        said than done. The ERP software should be properly
                        configured which allows further integration easily while
                        creating APIs that allow linking of ERP with websites

                        Smaller organizations who have just started to scale
                        their business recently need a good website which can
                        act as a first digital touch point for their current and
                        prospective leads/customers. A good website can help
                        resolve some queries of your leads/customers as well as
                        allow the organization to deliver the kind of message
                        they want to deliver for their organization. The website
                        plays an essential role as the organization grows as a
                        strong website would help answer most of the queries
                        going forward; it shall also act as a lead generator.

                      <p>
                        Some organizations, who have already invested in ERP,
                        have come to realize the rising cost of third-party
                        solutions as their own employees increase in the
                        organization, and hence they are moving to get custom
                        ERP solution for the organization that allows easier
                        scaling up in the number of users and features as per
                        the needs of the organization. Another advantage of
                        using a custom ERP solution is that this ERP would be
                        able to easily integrate with the organization’s website
                        as well as a mobile app which the organization may
                        decide to get developed or already has; however, the ERP
                        solution wasn’t integrated with the app.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To take advantage of Smartphone usage on the employees'
                        side, mobile apps are created that take into account the
                        data that gets fetched from ERP directly to the app and
                        vice versa; thus allowing employees to update leads,
                        sales figures, etc. directly from the app and providing
                        convenience to the employees.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Some organizations are also getting mobile apps created
                        for the consumer end of the business, where these apps
                        are being used by consumers to manage the services they
                        have availed from the organization. Thus, the consumers
                        are in complete control of their appointments, expenses
                        with the organization, next-due appointments, etc.
                        directly from the app. Studies have shown that consumers
                        really like apps where they can manage their services as
                        this gives them a sense of control over their
                        interaction with the business right from their pocket.

                        As any organization requires a good digital presence
                        which is already incorporated via the website; however,
                        organizations are also using social media to disseminate
                        information, attract leads, and create great offers.
                        However, it is difficult for organizations to manage
                        them as they don’t have expertise in managing social
                        media hence they often work with social media agencies
                        in managing content.

                        Organizations across the globe whether big or small have
                        realized the importance of using ERP as it allows these
                        organizations to streamline their business. However,
                        they are also using IT to improve other aspects of the
                        business as well.
